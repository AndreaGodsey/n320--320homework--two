# Description

A bit of a warning! When you click on the vercel link for my homework in this Read Me file, it will of course take you to the vercel page! However, the initial display for the vercel project, the box to the left, it does not initially show the fonts I used. But don't worry! Click on the project to view the link, and the fonts show up perfectly!

Throughout this website, I have used mulitple components, including repeating components such as the image at the top of the page. This image contains the words, Home, Products, About, and Contact, so the viewer can understand what page they are on. The images themselves on each page are also components, as well as the descriptions on the about and products page.

I currently need help with setting up a nesting route for all three buttons located in the Catering Services section of the Products page.
